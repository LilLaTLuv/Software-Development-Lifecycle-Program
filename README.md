## Essential Questions

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs and translating them into a functional program requires empathy, active listening, and a structured approach. User stories, with their concise format ("As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"), are instrumental in this process. They capture the essence of user needs, providing a clear understanding of what needs to be built and why. By focusing on the user's perspective, user stories help developers create programs that effectively address those needs.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Developing programs requires a flexible and adaptable approach, and Agile methodologies like Scrum provide an excellent framework. In future development work, I plan to incorporate several Agile processes:

* **Iterative Development:** Breaking down development into smaller sprints allows for frequent feedback and adjustments, leading to a better end product.
* **Continuous Testing:** Integrating testing throughout the development process ensures early detection of issues and improves overall quality.
* **Collaboration:** Close collaboration with stakeholders, including users, testers, and other developers, is crucial for creating a successful program.
* **Communication:** Open and transparent communication through daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives keeps everyone aligned and informed.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development goes beyond technical skills. It involves:

* **Active Collaboration:** Contributing ideas, listening to others, and working together to achieve shared goals.
* **Open Communication:** Clearly communicating progress, challenges, and ideas with the team.
* **Respectful Feedback:** Providing and receiving constructive feedback in a respectful and supportive manner.
* **Adaptability:** Being flexible and willing to adjust to changing requirements or priorities.
* **Support:** Offering help to teammates and celebrating shared successes.
